# proj02
This is Group 5's repository for Project 2 of Stat 159/259 Fall 2025. In this project, we explored different methods for textual analysis and natural language processing, focusing on a dataset of state of the union speeches. We aimed to learn more about these fields of study while ensuring that our work was reproducible by using tools such as environment files, Binder, and MyST sites.
