	I used Gemini for debugging issues with datahub (not project specific)
	
	Prompt:
	
	/home/jovyan/.local/share/envs/sotu/lib/python3.13/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:21: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found. Please update
	jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
	
	from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm
	
	Output:
	
	Recommended Fix (Get the better progress bar)
	To resolve the warning and enable the rich, interactive progress bars in your notebook, you need to ensure jupyter and ipywidgets
	are installed and up-to-date.
	
	You can run this command in your terminal or a new notebook cell (preceded by !, if in a notebook):
	
	Bash
	
	pip install --upgrade jupyter ipywidgets

	After installation, you might need to restart your Jupyter kernel.
